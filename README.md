# Pomomo
Pomomo is a desktop widget (or web app) that provides Pomodoro and a Task manager while gamifying studying! 
Inspired by Nashallery... pick an avatar or pet that will accompany you while you study - if you ware working online, it will tell you to keep working if it detects that you are not typing for longer then 5 minutes...

TO BE FURTHUR IMPROVED... The readme, I mean. The project is barely a wip right now.
